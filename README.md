Spoof_Spoof is an automated MITM attack. You can use it to do an ARP spoofing and sniffing the packet. Also, in the future with this program, perform automated DNS spoofing.
To make it right, you just need the IP target and your MAC adress. To help you choose an IP target, the program make a research in the network using nmap. After printing the different IP adress, make your choice and have
fun with this MITM attack.
